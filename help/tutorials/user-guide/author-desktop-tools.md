FrameMaker supports authoring and publishing of the content in AEM Guides. FrameMaker ships with an out-of-the-box connector to Adobe Experience Manager. FrameMaker also provides you with an easy-to-use interface that allows you to maintain versions of your documents in a distributed and collaborative environment. You can author your content in FrameMaker and publish in different formats - PDF, HTML5, EPUB, and DITA. You can also perform the various file management operations like checkout, checkout with dependents, check-in, refresh, and so on.
