# Manage metadata {#id221EJ0500LI}

Metadata is the description or definition of your content. This metadata is useful for defining your article or a map. For example, the PDF metadata may consist of the properties of a document like a title, author, subject, keywords, and language. AEM Guides provides various tools which can help you define metadata for your content.

Adobe Experience Manager Assets provide the support to add, edit, import, or export metadata for your assets. You can use XML Keyword Extract tool to extract smart tags with the help of relevant keywords. Smart tags can help you find your related content. You can also define metadata in bulk for a collection of files and folders. Bulk tagging can help you easily find related topics within a DITA map.
