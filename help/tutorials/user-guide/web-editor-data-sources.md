# Use data from your data source

A **data source** is a location or system where you can store and manage the data for your organization. AEM Guides provides the feature to connect with your data source and use the data from them. 

## Data Sources panel

Select **Data Sources** ![](images/data-source-icon.svg) in the left panel to view the connected data sources. The Data Sources panel opens and displays all the connected data sources. For more details, view [Configure a data source connector](../install-guide/conf-data-source-connector.md). 

>[!NOTE]
>
> You will see the data sources for which your administrator has configured the connector. 


## Show Tile/List View  

You can choose to view the various data sources in the form of a list or as tiles. Select a data source to view the content snippet generators and the topic generators available for the selected data source.
