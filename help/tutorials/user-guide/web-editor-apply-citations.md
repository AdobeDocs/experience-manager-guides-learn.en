# Add citations to your content

Citations are references to the source or credits to the author added to the content. Add the citations to your project and apply them to your content. You can add these citations from any source of books, websites, and journals. Citations are only visible in PDF outputs. You can find the catalog for them at the end of the PDF. For some scenarios, itâ€™s mandatory to add citations. There are three main reasons to include citations in your content.

* To credit the authors of the source information you use for your content.
* To help readers to follow up on the source information.
* To display well-researched content.
There are different styles to display the citations having formats like MLA, APA, Chicago, IEEE, and AHA. The recommendation is to use them clearly and consistently. It makes your content more reliable and prevents plagiarism.
