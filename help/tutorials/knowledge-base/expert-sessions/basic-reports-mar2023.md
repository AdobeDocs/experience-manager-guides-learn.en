# Author web-based content

In an organizational setup, you want to verify the overall completeness of your content before you push the documents for consumption by end users. Such a need becomes even more essential in multi-user and large-scale environments where content can be re-used in different contexts hence validating your content or document is a necessity. In the context of structured content, there are some specific types of reports that are commonly needed.

- AEM assets reporting capability
