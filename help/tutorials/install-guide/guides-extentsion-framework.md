# AEM Guides Extension Framework 

Customize your instance of AEM Guides and add the extensions to it. You can create custom packages on top of AEM Guides. These packages provide extensibility to the components in the Web Editor. If youâ€™re a developer you can use these packages, and add customized buttons, dialogs, and dropdowns in the Web Editor. These customized components can help you display additional information or perform specific tasks. You can also add custom JavaScript that can easily interoperate with AEM Guides UI.
